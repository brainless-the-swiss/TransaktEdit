# Transaction labelling

## What it is and how to use it

This python program allows you to quickly categorize financial transactions.

To use it, start by editing the paths.json file:
 - "data": full path name to the csv file containing the transactions data
 - "categories": full path name to the csv file containing the categories
 - "outputCsv": full path name to the output csv

Now you're ready to run it.

## Unit tests

Unit tests can be run using the command "python -m unittest paned_window.py". Feel free to add more tests.

## Future developments

This is currently only a first iteration.
Please send me any remarks/comments so that I can enhance it iteratively.
There are multiple things to improve for a better usability...
Feel free to edit it yourself.

One suggestion would be to make this program directly edit data in a database instead of CSV files.
